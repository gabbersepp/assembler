# Long time ago
I loved assembler and spent lot of time in coding ASM and writing tutorials about it. I also created a own operating system. 
If you like to see some bad written code (I was tender 15 years old ;-P ) or are just as crazy as I was and want to see ASM code, feel free to download my code :-)
